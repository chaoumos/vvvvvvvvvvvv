Here are a few things you might want to do next:

1.  **Customize your theme**: Look into the theme's documentation (`Ananke`). You might need to add it as a Hugo Module (`hugo mod init your/module/path` then `hugo mod get -u https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke.git` if it's a module-compatible theme, or clone it into the `themes/` directory).
2.  **Update `hugo.toml`**: Fine-tune your site's configuration.
3.  **Create more content**: Add new Markdown files to `content/posts/`.
4.  **Explore Hugo features**: Check out [Hugo Documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/).

Enjoy your new blog!
